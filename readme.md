##Disclaimer: this was an evening project made as fast as I could. It is full of hacks and bad code. Enjoy!
1. There's a 2D game board with square fields (20x20)
2. Everybody has a tank
3. Every tank starts with 5 Health Points
3. You start the game with 3 Action Points
4. You get a new AP every 8 hours
  . You can spend your AP by:
  * moving â€“ one field (manhattan dist) for one AP
  * shoot a neighbouring tank - 2 field dist max (manhattan) for one AP
  * you can give your AP to another player
6. It isn't turnbased, you can make your moves whenever you want
